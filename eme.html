        <h2>Discover Palawan</h2>
        <p>Palawan, a land locked in time. Whether it be the magnificent natural wonders, ancient artifacts and handicrafts, or indigenous beliefs and dialects, there’s a time-honored quality about all things Palawan, which has preserved its cultural glory for centuries. Palawan’s distinct charm lies in its harmonious blend of natural wonders and cultural richness. The warmth and hospitality of its local communities of Palaw’an, combined with its ecological significance, have earned it the well-deserved title of “The Last Ecological Frontier of the Philippines.” Though, these ideas merely scratch the surface of the true depth of Palawan’s culture and heritage.</p>
        
        <p>Palawan's history is a tapestry of cultural influences and historical events that have shaped the island's unique identity. This gives credence to the many reasons it is known as the “last frontier of the Philippines.” The earliest known cultural influence can be attributed to pre-colonial Austronesian inhabitants of the province, the Palaw’ans and Tagbanuas people, who have yielded some of the best works of indigenous art. The most well-known being Burial Jars, also known as the “ship-of-the-dead,” the Manunggul Jar is a burial container that represents the journey of the soul to the afterlife. Another significant foundation of the culture of Palawan hails from the province’s most marginalized sector. For fifteen centuries, Palawan was under Muslim rule while influenced by the Sulu Sultanate of the southern Philippines. Despite the near eradication of this ancient Muslim culture, remnants of its influence still stand today, through the vibrant colors used by the Muslim mat weavers in Brooke's Point. Muslim weavers of Palawan create such intricate mats, and despite its common title of banig, stands out in the splendor of vivid colors and patterns woven into its very fibers. Perhaps the most threatened aspect of Palawan’s culture are the ancient beliefs and traditions of the indigenous tribes of the province. Vocal and musical traditions are one of the more well-known ways that these traditions are kept in ties with the modern age. Bagit is an important part of the Filipino Folk Culture in Puerto Princesa. Bird, snake, insect, leaf, and element sounds, as well as birds’, monkeys’, snakes’, and insect chirping, can all be heard in this type of instrumental music. It’s usually played on a wooden, three-stringed lute called a kusyapi.</p>

        <p>Humanity’s never-ending advancement has threatened the many cultural and ecological markers that herald Palawan as “The Last Frontier.” Palawan is more than just the pristine islands and natural wonders of tourist fame; it is a melting pot of different cultures that have made incredible works of arts and traditions, that have been overlooked for far too long. These are the last ties that we have to the works of our predecessors. The glory of their legacy must be preserved, as such it is the duty of their successors to take up the torch that they have lit, to light the path of an unsung history.</p>
